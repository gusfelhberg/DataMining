Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...\n\nAs for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. \n\nOverall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise!

{"text": "My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.\n\nI placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................\n\nChicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.\n\nSesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!\n\nEgg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.\n\nDeep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  \n\nOverall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............", "id": 19}

I had the Mango Thai Shrimp, apparently, which was good. Right amount of spice in the dish. Not too heavy, either. Steve and Chris had their own plates as well, both of which looked appetizing.

Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today.", "id": 23}
{"text": "Pretty good food a chain. You do get a lot of food for the price. However, every time I have ordered online there has been a mistake. Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well.", "id": 24}

They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! \n\nThe only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.

Ordered fried wontons, sweet and sour beef, Mongolian beef, honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles.  \n\nThe Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.\n\nHoney crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.\n\nOrdered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.\n\nThey brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he \"let us keep the spring rolls\" and \"didn't charge is for all of our drinks\" as if he did us a favor.\n\nOverall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!\n\nI wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day..", "id": 26}

We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive.

He was also super fast; I think all of us were surprised how quickly our meals came out. \n\nAs for the food, I feel like it's a little difficult to review.  I had never been here before and my Mexican palate is less-than-sophisticated, so I randomly ordered a plain enchilada and quesadilla.  The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    \n\nThe chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  \n\nI'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.

The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me.

{"text": "for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three.  okay. lets break it down.\n\nthe service.  when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive.  we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available.  there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair.  not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal.   i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three.  if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine.  the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience.  every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself.  its not the problem of the customer.  its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself.\n\nfor lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup.  we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip.  not exorbitant and not cheap.  though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home.  in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not.  but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti.  its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is.\n\nthat being said the sandwiches tasted great.  (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\").\n\nthe vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.\n\ni enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.\n\nall my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.", "id": 51}

Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate.\n\n\nThe dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating.\n\nWe had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent.\n\nIt was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day.

{"text": "Considering the amount of rave reviews on here, I suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at Table 17. Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression. So did my guests.\n\nThe dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed. Still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. \n\nOur server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. Scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. It was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. \n\nOur table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so I ordered another glass of wine so I could enjoy some with dinner. That glass arrived 20 mins after I was finished my main. Lots of apologies but little else.\n\nThat being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. And the space is gorgeous. However, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great. The Halibut was the best of the bunch.\n\nConsidering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, I won't visit again.", "id": 60}
{"text": "Booked through OpenTable a few days before, for 8pm. Zipped right in to our table.\nHad the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow! The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big b\u00e9arnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon).\n\nHad the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates.\nMy friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert.\n\nThe cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car!\nMy friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert.\n\nAll in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum. We agreed though that we'd give it another chance based on the scallops alone.\n\nThe service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable.

{"text": "The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed. \n\nFirstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( \n\nThe only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. \n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing! \n\n-CL \n\nPS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :)", "id": 65}
{"text": "On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well.\n\nThough the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine.\n\nRight off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. \n\nStill, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.\n\nAnd once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his \"little neglected table.\" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.\n\nFood-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the \"shared food\" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. \n\nRich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a \"sugo\" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.\n\nAlongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained \"sauce & balls\" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were \"al dente\" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.\n\nWines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's \"Anna 6\" white was very dry and very refreshing. \n\nIn addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was \"out\" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.\n\nTotal cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.\nThis would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.\n\nI would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.", "id": 66}

I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!  It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine.  \n\nWe went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!", "id": 69}

Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing.\n\nFor dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty.

{"text": "Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.\n\nWent to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.\n\nFood:\nThe server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.\n\nTo start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. \n\nFor my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.\n\nMy date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. \n\nWe contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.\n\nOnly main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.\n\nNot sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.\n\nOverall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.", "id": 76}

{"text": "\"Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,\" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.\n\nI wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.\n\nThe kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.\n\nA meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.\n\nI've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.\n\n\nOysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.\n\nWe opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.\n\nFor our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).\n\nThe Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit \"salad\" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.\n\nOur dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.\n\nSide dishes are available \u00e0 la carte and we opt for the saut\u00e9ed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.\n\nAs with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.\n\nThe message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.\n\nOur meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17.", "id": 78}
{"text": "Great service, the food and drinks were a miss.\n\nLimited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.\n\nPOLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.\n\nMains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. \n\nThe recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.\n\nOverall, I'd have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine.", "id": 79}

I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my \"age\" and our voucher. \n\nAfter that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. \n\nThe restaurant crowd wasn't my style either.

{"text": "The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.  It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.  \n\nThe good:\n- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality\n- Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees\n- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu\n- They do potato rosti right\n- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon\n- Good service both times I've been\n- Proximity to my house\n- they use opentable\n\nThe bad:\n- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here.\n- It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there.

{"text": "I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. \n\nI can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. \n\nSpecials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). \n\nWe started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. \n\nI opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. \n\nWe passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!", "id": 86}

{"text": "I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review.\n\nAmong the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering.\n\nI am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!) \n\nThat said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco.", "id": 88}

The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.\n\nTo be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices. \n\nMaybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed.", "id": 92}
{"text": "I'm confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back. \n\nThe food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!\n\nMy bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore.", "id": 93}

Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini).", "id": 95}

{"text": "Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.\n\nMy pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. \n\nSlinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.\n\nPortions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.\n\nService is excellent.\n\nTable 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work.", "id": 99}

The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn't even order.

The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts.

First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance.  Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South.  \n\nMy specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light.   We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it.  I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's.  There are 3 pools on site too.  \n\nAs far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job.  Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it!  Good service, helpful attitude.  \n\nOnly negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them.  Annoying.

I had liked what I'd seen on the walk-throughs, and everyone in the office was pleasant enough.  One thing I'd noticed, however, is that the prices for their available units change every day.  So I waited until the price was where I wanted it to be, and headed over with the full intent to sign a one-year lease.\n\nRight before I entered the leasing office, I pulled up their website on my phone and confirmed the amount.  I walked in and was seated with an agent/manager with whom I had toured the property less than a week ago.  We made small talk, and she pulled up the unit in question...and quoted me a price ten dollars higher than what I saw online.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but I was quite confused.\n\nI pulled up the price on my phone again and noted that at that very instant, there was a discrepancy between what she said and what I saw online.  Her defense was that \"[their] prices change every day,\" but when I asked about the accuracy of the online pricing, she just repeated the line.\n\nI tried to find out why she would give me a different price quote, and she just repeated the line again.  I had my phone, and the unit price, staring me in the face, and she was telling me that it was wrong!  She then said that I should have booked during the previous week and said goodbye, as she apparently wasn't willing to negotiate down to their listed price or explain what was going on.\n\nI have no idea why she couldn't say something like, \"Our website isn't accurate - you should call,\" or, \"Let me see what I can do\" or anything like that. She was willing to lose someone who was ready to sign ON THE SPOT because she couldn't be bothered to explain a slight difference in rent rates.\n\nIf this is how they treat prospective tenants who WANT to live there and pay their rent, I can't imagine how they treat their residents.", "id": 106}

Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.\n\nOne small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.\n\nYou can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.

Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible.  I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both.  And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy).  So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland.", "id": 142}

My friends and I weren't aware of that and got a little carried away when we got our tab for all the drinks, pizza and wings was just under $100!\n\nOn Monday nights they have a AYCE taco bar with ground beed and chicken, as well as assorted toppings. The pico de gallo was very fresh, the shredded romaine was crisp, and the salsa had a nice bite to it.

{"text": "I have been to Christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however, last night's meal was a disaster! It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid.", "id": 145}

He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location. \n\nStarving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills).\n\nAs we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby.

At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us.\nBrief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks.\n30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was \"didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?\" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they \"were just catching up\". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area.\n5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it.", "id": 148}

We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want.   \nThe menus at the table were all different.   Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the \"baskets\" on it.  Weird!!  The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water.  When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it.  After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better.  It finally was.   The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well.  \nOverall, the food was good.   Burger was juicy and flavorful and he bacon wrapped shrimp was really yummy.  The pizza at the table next to us looked delish and may be ordered if we return. \nThe place has some potential but a little makeover would be great!!!", "id": 150}

She responds by saying \"the bread is fresh.\" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything.  \nAfter the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me.

I'm not a fan of this place, but decided to give it another chance as my friend wanted to eat here.\n\nThe place has been upgraded, which is about the only good thing with this restaurant. The new management is pathetic and the food equally worse. We went in on a Monday night for dinner and the waitress took our order and took close to half and hour to get our appetizer. The vada was spoilt and when we mentioned it to her, she just ran away and came back after a while to say that \"This is how it is\" !!! and she did not even apologize. How Rude!!!! She seemed to have a lengthy discussion in the Kitchen and another waitress came to our table and served our food almost 40 minutes later. She did however apologize for the delay. Much better than our previous waitress.

The little bowls that the sambar came in...that was a mystery...some of them were stuck inside the other- probably the dishwasher could not get them separated- so basically that meant that the lower one was dirty.

{"text": "It seems that a lot of reviewers have already shared their strong feelings on the flavor (or the lack thereof) of Saravanaa Bhavan. To be honest, it's not terrible like some of the reviews would have you believe. But it's not particularly amazing either. Maybe if we had ordered from the menu, it would have been better, but we opted for the buffet option, and it was all... one-note... Not bad. Just not mind-blowing. It was food stuffs that helped fill our bellies before we left town. It's closer to a [*][*] experience in that \"I've experienced better\" but a lot of the [*] reviews are unnecessarily harsh. \n\nI didn't touch the sambar. Sambar is one of those things that varies quite a bit even between two people from the same part of India. Personal experience has taught me that ingesting sambar (especially sambar that you've never had before) before a long road trip (or in my case, a long road trip and then a long plane trip) is asking for trouble and shaky leg syndrome.", "id": 227}

{"text": "I would like to update my review on this place based on my experiences since.\nI decided to try something different other than the usual thali. So I tried their Kara dosa, which came out to be a thick, soggy dosa with a sweet tomatoey sauce. Then when I visited again I decided to give their dosa's another shot and opted for their Mysore masala dosa, which I have loved in other restaurants. They warned me that this dosa is supposed to be spicy but I can handle heat so I was fine with that. But again, I ended up getting a overly thick dosa that was too soggy and tasteless. My brother got the chole bhatura, which he enjoyed but complained that the bhatura's were a bit too oily. \nSo I feel that ordering something other than the dosa would be your best bet because their dosa's are just not worth it and you can get much better ones at Guru Lukshmi or Udupi.", "id": 229}

{"text": "I am a huge fan of Guru Lukshmi and they set a really high bar for dosa in GTA. Unfortunately, Saravanaa Bhavan was a big letdown. We went in pretty late on a sunday afternoon. The decor has been recently upgraded which gives the place a clean modern look although it is still based in a strip mall. \n\nMost tables around us were having the thali which should have given us some strong signals. \n\nWe ordered the vada sambar but the quality of the sambar was not good. The vada was not crispy as well which let the whole dish down. \n\nThe onion and chili utappam was the biggest disappointment. It was so thick and dry inside that after a few bites we just did not have the appetite to finish it. The chillies were huge and it was quite a task to remove them from the almost thick pizza crust like utappam. \n\nThe saving grace was the onion rava dosa but they had stuffed pepper in it which was annoying since it was quite strong. The accompanying chutney portion is too small and they were not flavorful at all. \n\nI am never going back again! Go spend your money at Guru Lukshmi. I am surprised they are a global chain with such poor quality of south indian food.", "id": 233}
{"text": "Saravanaa has gone on a steep downhill trajectory over the past few years in food quality and service. The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance. \n\nBut ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily.\n\nMy dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items? \n\nAnd it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait.\n\nThe waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us \"the air conditioning was not working\". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all. \n\nThis restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations.\n\nMy mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that.\n\nPROS:\n- nice ambiance, comfortable booths\n- delicious, spicy sambar\n\nCONS: \n- oily dosas with virtually no filling\n- crowded early, stays that way through dinner\n- NOT good for groups (call ahead)\n- hasty servers who do not consider the weather\n- miniature food", "id": 234}
{"text": "Great Masala Dosa - the mustard seed flavour of the Masala is perfect. The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had.

{"text": "We usually go to Anjappar Chettinad one weekends when I have a strong craving for a South Indian breakfast. My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two. \nWe decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options. \nThe breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up. We were seated at 11:30. \nThe first thing I noticed was that the dosas, idlis and vadas are much better than anjappar and are really well made. The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well. \nOne of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be. \nWe asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total. \nFor two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip. \n\nI have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing. \n\nFinal verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee\nDisliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience. \n\nWon't return.", "id": 236}

I eat my vada with sambar,  my dosa with rice and tomato chutney, and my puri with potato or rice. It tastes amazing and I've never left without being so full that I'm uncomfortable, which is a good thing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because they need to expand.

The food item itself can't be that horrible or else no one would eat it, right? But you see, I'm traumatized to a point where I might not even consider re-evaluating what they taste like and just leave it at that. \n\nThe service was shoddy. The drink prices (non-alcoholic) are shitty for the amount you get, which is close to nothing. The venue looks like a McDonald's in an airport food court. If this is what they think south India should be, then I recommend that Britain reoccupy. \n\nThe only thing I'd recommend is the Madras coffee, to-go.

I was told that they would arrange a shuttle service to get me home, and I've been sitting in the lobby waiting forever ! Then the last time I checked with them, they told me that where I live, which is Bloor and Dufferin, which is practically still downtown, is too far, so they can't drive me home,\nbut they can drop me off at a subway station. Then the guy promised me to drop me off at Young and Bloor, and told me their driver was outside and would be back in 5 mins, then I continued to wait, for another 45 mins until my car's ready, and I drove home. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service, because of that, I need to re-arrange my plans for the afternoon. The guy at the desk was like \" It's been crazy today. There's nothing we can do\". If you are considering getting an Audi, I strongly recommend you getting your car at other dealers. The service here was unacceptable. I also came in once because I noticed the drive's side mirror didn't change angles when I back up, and it supposed to. I had to explain it over and over again, but they failed to fix it for the first 2 times. Overall, I am so disappointed with the service, now that my warranty is expired, I don't think I'll ever come back.", "id": 263}

They have about six beers that they brew and another six to eight beers that they bring in. There's a food truck parked on site, I ordered the street tacos. \nI love the inside as much as the outside. There are plenty of tables, high tops, low tops and  bar seating.  This place has a cool vibe. Staff is friendly. They were more than happy to give samples of their brews with no charge. That, in my opinion, is good business.\nI will definitely be back for another visit .....soon! \nLoved it!", "id": 266}

I stumbled upon The Shop's tent in the first hour and I didn't leave.  I kept going back because they were pouring this delicious IPA that I couldn't get enough of, I didn't care what anyone else was pouring - it was that good.  \n\nWhen I got back to Phoenix I couldn't find the brewery anywhere.  No one had heard of The Shop, it was like I made it all up in my drunken stupor.  Finally someone did mention the name and I got the scoop that they wouldn't be opening for until August.  I started counting down the days till opening so I could get a taste of summa that epic beer, today was that day!\n\nMy favorite brew is a double IPA is called FYITM.  Someone told me it stands for Fuck You In The Mouth and I don't know if that's true or not but I do know that my taste buds get an orgasm every time the beer enters my mouth so I think it's a solid name.", "id": 272}

{"text": "I'm a little wary of Asian fusion restaurants, and I wasn't sure quite what to expect from Muramoto, but my dining partners (a chef and a personal chef) and I were thoroughly pleased with our light dinner on Saturday evening. \n\nWe had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.\n\nActually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. \n\nContrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came. \n\nBTW, make reservations. We weren't in a hurry, so we went and had a drink and came back, but the dining area is quite small, so if you have more than two people you'll definitely want to call ahead on a weekend evening.", "id": 275}
{"text": "Muramoto is a paradise if you are a sake lover. Their collection is enormous and I believed the owner claimed Muramoto has the best collection in midwest. If you are a sake lover and haven't been there, what  are you waiting for? and if you don't usually drink sake, you should still try the sake out (especially the ones list under fragrant) and you might change your view about sake forever.\n\nFor the food Muramoto is Asian fusion in tapas style. Although each plate might be only around $10, most of them are not filling (rolls are the exceptions) and at the end combining your sake bill the check might cost as much as $100 per person.", "id": 276}

However, their shochu drinks are more extensive at this location, so I had a shochu shiso mojito.  It was okay--not my favorite, but not bad either.  Maybe I should have tried a drink that wasn't trying to be another drink.  \n\nAnyway, the place is really nice, the bartenders are really nice.  Well worth a visit.", "id": 278}

{"text": "Please note: Pricey, gourmet Restaurant Muramoto has moved down the street, and Kushi Muramoto has become a sort of \"Izakaya\" style place. Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. \n\nI was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. \n\nI also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.\n\nThe pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang. Also, it's really reasonably priced. $4 drafts. $1.50-$2 things on a stick, $5.50-$8 for Donburi. So you can go out and feel like you're getting the \"Muramoto Experience\" without bleeding yourself dry.\n\nHowever, when they said \"fried Snickers are our only dessert and they're only 2 for a dollar,\" I was so sick of panko fried tidbits, I said \"no\" without a moment or regret.", "id": 280}

The place looked \"hip\" but that's about as cool as it got.   If you are looking to make a fashion statement then by all means dress yourself up and head to Muramoto, if you are looking to enjoy your meal (be it tapas, sushi, real japanese or some fusion) look elsewhere.", "id": 281}
{"text": "ASIAN FUSION WITH INCREDIBLE SAKE MENU.\n\nAll info I've seen says 'tapas style', but I will tell you - these plates are not too small, and quite filling. Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.\n\nEvery so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!", "id": 282}

Never disappointing.", "id": 283}
{"text": "I am infatuated with my new love, Muramoto. At first, I was highly doubtful the state of Wisconsin could feature decent sushi but boy oh boy was I wrong. Mad props incredibly for the fact that they feature a deeeelicious Philly role with salmon and cream cheese. Heavenly! I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick. And last but certainly not least, I could drink a million of the Russian teas (a smooth mixture of kahlua and green tea vodka, which I have never tried or seen before this restaurant introduced me to it!) \n\nI end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything! This is the first place of many in Madison that I have graced with 5 stars because I was that impressed!", "id": 284}

{"text": "I was looking for a nail parlor that was close-ish to my area, and this place by far had the best and most consistent reviews. Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there. \n\nIt's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.\n\nI do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience.\n\nBut getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again. \n\nAnd I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.\n\nA week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. \n\nI think I might have found my newest addiction, and I'll definitely be back to get them done again! \n\nPlease do note that you can pay with DEBIT cards, but not credit. Also, like several reviewers noted below- bring CASH to tip.", "id": 295}

I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!! \nI sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A..\n\nHow can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license!  \nI owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails.", "id": 298}

Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes. They seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a Friday night which should make them happy, right?", "id": 319}
{"text": "Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. \nWe ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. \nThe bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+\nThe salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B\nNext our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a \"back-of-the-throat\" heat which is perfect. So: \"A\" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! \nOverall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. \nI highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu.", "id": 320}

{"text": "Overpriced and flavroless.  This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short.\n\nThe bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter.  The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing.  \n\nI had the chicken marsala ($18).  The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender.  The sauce, however, was a mess.  It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan.  It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.\n\nMy wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.  I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else.  She chose broccoli for her side.  Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal.\n\nCome here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards.  The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out.\n\nI only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick.", "id": 323}

The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much.\n\nThe service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price. \n\nThe decor is nice. That's it.

They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.

I feel I got a very fair price on the work that was done.\n\nI plan on adding 4 more cameras down the line and will definitely use them again.", "id": 361}

I had to buy garbage bags to carry passengers the next couple days so they could sit on them. This past visit for regular maintenance I Was called because there were a few light bulbs out. I said I would do it myself and I found them changed anyway and the $38 added in at the end of my bill after pick up.

A life sized Justin Bieber cut out (my 11 year old selfs secret fantasy), was strategically display in the front window of the Beauty Boutique along with his latest fragrance line to draw in any stray window shoppers ( of course I'm convincing myself it was really my subconscious wanting to escape the mere minus 30 weather outside) \n\nWalking in I certainly didn't expect to walk out with over $200 worth of cosmetics. Upon first entering I was greeted by a lovely tall, bubbly, blonde that not only looked but sounded like a Disney princess. She was quick to ask if I needed any help or if there was anything in particular I was looking for. When I assured her I was just \"browsing\" as us window shoppers do, she offered to give me a complimentary makeover. I have never been one to decline a little free pampering here and there so I quickly obliged making my self comfortable on a fancy black chair next to her. \n\nAnd so It began; a little Clarins Ever Matte foundation, followed by both Benefit blush in Coralista and Benefit They're Real mascara ( which might I add is probably the best mascara in the existence of mascaras), next was the Lise Watier lipstick in Evasion and to finish it off a spritz of Marc Jacobs new scent \"Dot\" ...vuala  she held up a mirror to show me her finished canvas and ten minutes later I was standing at the check out. \n\nThe customer service was great, the product knowledge of the associate was excellent, the sales pitch was well played, the free samples were an added bonus...oh and my fancy new picture beside the Justin Bieber cutout left my 11 year old self jumping up and down on the inside.

{"text": "Don't believe the hype. Nooooo! \n\nIn the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items. \n\nGranted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else. \n\nG Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?). \n\nThe fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.  \n\nThe buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served. \n\nThe sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be). \n\nIt isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a \"Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant\" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname. \n\nThe service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread. \n\nSort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks. \n\nI'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients).", "id": 385}
{"text": "Don't believe the hype!\n\nAfter seeing this location on Man vs Food I had to check it out for myself. I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions. \n\nThe place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.\n\nThe employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.\n\nThe chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes.

We got the fried chicken, stuck the sauce on the side...but I can see why people just have it drenching that chicken.  Glad we did get it on the side, though, since it was glorious to dip everything into it.  Almost ordered another fries just as a vehicle for the hot sauce.", "id": 388}

I think I have been to better buffets before.\n\nTerrible customer service earned them one out five stars. Extremely rude and inconsiderate server.

She decided to have side conversations while we were still ordering.\n\nFood: I ordered the Polish Boy and Dark Meat Chicken. \n\nPolish Boy: Polish Sausage, Coleslaw, Fries, and BBQ sauce on a bun. It was drenched in sauce, making the bun soggy. It was not bad but was not all that. The sauce is not very good for BBQ. It is runny like Open Pit and has a little zing to it. Adam Richman was high when he said this sauce was incredible.\n\nChicken: Very good chicken, dark meat. The breading was very crispy and the meat was juicy. I enjoyed this part of the meal.\n\nOverall, I would not return. No place should treat their guests with such arrogance and ineptness. I think I would rather take my money to Popeye's, its most comparable match.", "id": 390}

The fried okra was decent, but was coated in so much batter that I could barely taste the okra.\nIn addition to the good food, the service is also worth mentioning- everyone behind the counter was hospitable and made for a great first visit to Hot Sauce Williams", "id": 392}

I've seen their slogan around town \"Voted #1 for Ribs\" so we were excited, but after taking our first bite into those saucy ribs, we looked at each other and said \"meh\" as we have had better. The chicken on the other hand, drenched in BBQ sauce, was interesting. It was saucy yet crispy so it was an interesting dish, we probably favor the chicken over the ribs.

OK!\" She then asked me \"You want our sauce on your chicken?\" To which i asked \" I dont know, do i?\" She promptly said yes and ladled it on. For those who dont know.. A polish girl is a sausage (hot dog like) on a bun with french fries, pulled pork, coleslaw and their sauce.. Its about as good of a sandwich as you will ever taste. \nNow fellow Yelpers.. I have been known to exaggerate a little to heighten the effectiveness and entertainment value of a good story.. But i say to you today.... That is the best fried chicken that has ever passed my lips. The very wise and helpful woman who took my order was appreciated ever time i took a bite of that chicken. That sauce.. complimenting an already outstanding chicken breast.. I well up with tears just thinking about how unbelievably good that food was. \n\nOn another note.. Buy a F*cking mop already.. The place is absolutely deplorable. I needed rubber gloves and a hasmat suit to enter the place. Seriously... what is that 10 years of grime on the molding? Its absolutely disgusting.
