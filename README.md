The code we're submitting for the project includes multiple .py programs. 

Each program represents a specific algorithm and will run a training process and output a set of predictions corresponding
to the given test data set.

We're also including "combineOutputs.py", a program that can be run by using python3 combineOutputs.py file1 file2 file3 ... fileX , and it'll produce an output file that represents the average of the predicted scores of all the files in the list. We used this in the project in order to obtain the ensemble average of the predictions, which ended up giving us a better score in Kaggle.
